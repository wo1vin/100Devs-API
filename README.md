# 100Devs-API
This 100Devs class materials API is a work in progress that allows you to access class materials from the second cohort (2022).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express Framework
Following Leon Noel's thorough walkthough of building and hosting an API, I considered what theme I'd choose, but quickly realized that all of my deas for Restful APIs had already been done. Which is why I instead thpught about the current projects that I'm working on and decided to make an API that would be useful for the group project that I'm involved in. The group project's goal is to create an app that would help users with ADHD stay on top of the class.

## Optimizations

I'd love to design the Doc page on brand with 100Devs and of course fill in all of the class information and materials.

## Lessons Learned:

This project opened my eyes to how simple back-end programming can be.
